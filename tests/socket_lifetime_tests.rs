//! Tests covering the lifetime of the rings handed to libxdp.
//!
//! libxdp does not copy the rings it is passed, it keeps the pointers
//! (`xsk->rx`, `xsk->tx`, `ctx->fill` and `ctx->comp`) and reads them
//! again during teardown to work out which memory to unmap. If a
//! ring has moved or been freed by then, `xsk_socket__delete` unmaps
//! a garbage address. The mapping, and with it the kernel's reference
//! to the socket, is then never released and every subsequent bind to
//! the same device and queue id fails with `EBUSY`.
//!
//! Since it is the *teardown* that is broken, a test only notices if
//! it binds to the same device and queue id a second time, which is
//! what these tests do, in a variety of drop orders.
//!
//! The other half of the story is that a ring must not be unmapped
//! while a queue can still reach it, which is why the fill and comp
//! queues keep their socket alive rather than just the UMEM.
